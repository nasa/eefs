 * Filename: eefs_fileapi.h
 *
 * Purpose: This file contains the lower level interface functions to the eeprom file system api functions.  These functions
 *   are volume or device independent, so most functions require a pointer to a inode table.  All api functions are designed
 *   to be as similar to a standard unix file system api as possible.
 *
 * Design Notes:
 *
 * File System Design:
 *   The EEPROM File System is a standard file system interface for data stored in EEPROM.  The EEPROM File System is a slot
 *   based file system where each slot is a fixed size contiguous region of memory allocated for a single file.  Note that
 *   each slot can be a different size.  The size of each slot is determined when the file system is created and is based
 *   on the size of the file to be stored in the slot.  Additional free space can be to the end of each slot to allow room
 *   for the file to grow in size if necessary.  Since this file system is intended to be used for EEPROM it is unlikely
 *   that files in the file system will change very often, so in most cases it will be used as a write once, read many file
 *   system. The file system is organized this way for the following reasons:
 *   1. Keeping each file in one contiguous area of memory makes it easier to patch or reload eeprom without going through
 *      the file system interface if required by on-orbit maintenance.
 *   2. This file system is intended to be used for eeprom, so in most cases it will be used as a write once, read many
 *      file system.  So it is unlikely that files in the file system will change very often.
 *   3. Simplifies the design of the file system.
 *
 * File System Structure:
 *   The file system begins with a File Allocation Table and then is followed by slots for each file in the
 *   file system.  Each slot contains a File Header followed by the File Data.
 *       File Allocation Table
 *       File Header (Slot 0)
 *       File Data   (Slot 0)
 *       File Header (Slot 1)
 *       File Data   (Slot 1)
 *       . . .
 *       File Header (Slot N)
 *       File Data   (Slot N)
 *
 * File Allocation Table:
 *   The File Allocation Table defines where in memory each slot starts as well as the maximum slot size for each file.
 *   This table is a fixed size regardless of how many files actually reside in the file system and never changes unless
 *   a new file is added to the file system using the EEFS_LibCreat() function or the whole file system is reloaded.  The
 *   maximum number of files that can be added to the file system is determined at compile time by the EEFS_MAX_FILES
 *   define.  It is important to choose this number carefully since a code patch would be required to change it.  The file
 *   offsets for each file defined in the File Allocation Table are relative offsets from the beginning of the file system
 *   and point to the start of the File Header.  Since they are relative offsets the file system in not tied to any
 *   physical address.  In fact the exact same file system image can be burned into multiple locations of EEPROM and then
 *   mounted as different volumes.  The size of each slot is specified in bytes and does NOT include the File Header.  So
 *   each slot actually occupies (File Header Size + Slot Size) bytes of EEPROM.
 *
 * File Header:
 *   Each slot in the file system starts with a File Header.  The File Header contains information about the file
 *   contained in the slot.  The File Header will be all 0's if the file has been deleted or is unused.
 *
 * File Data:
 *   File Data starts immediately following the File Header and may or may not use all of the available space in the slot.
 *
 * Inode Table:
 *   The Inode Table is a ram table that is used by the file system api to access the file system and is similar in structure
 *   to the File Allocation Table.  The Inode table is initialized when the function EEFS_LibInitFS() is called and once the
 *   Inode table is initialized the File Allocation Table is no longer used. One important difference between the File
 *   Allocation Table and the Inode Table is that the Inode Table contains physical address pointers to the start of each file
 *   instead of relative offsets.  Note also that the Inode table does not cache any information about the file in ram.  This
 *   means that the file could be patched or reloaded to EEPROM without the need to patch the Inode Table, i.e. the file
 *   updates are available to the file system immediately.  A disadvantage to this approach is that each File Header must be
 *   read from EEPROM when searching the file system for a specific file, for example when a file is opened.
 *
 * File Descriptor Table:
 *   The File Descriptor Table manages all File Descriptors for the EEPROM File System.  There is only one File Descriptor
 *   Table that is shared by all EEPROM File System volumes.  The maximum number of files that can be open at one time is
 *   determined at compile time by the EEFS_MAX_OPEN_FILES define.
 *
 * Directory Descriptor Table:
 *   The Directory Descriptor Table manages the Directory Descriptor for the EEPROM File System.  There is currently only
 *   one Directory Descriptor that is shared by all EEPROM File System volumes.
 *
 * EEPROM Access:
 *   The EEPROM File System software never directly reads or writes to EEPROM, instead it uses implementation specific EEPROM
 *   interface functions.  Since not all EEPROM is memory mapped, some EEPROM implementations may require implementation
 *   specific functions for accessing EEPROM.  The implementation specific EEPROM interface functions are defined as macros
 *   in the file eefs_macros.h.  By default these macros are defined to use memcpy.  Note also that the EEPROM interface
 *   functions are protected from shared access by the EEPROM File System however there is nothing that prevents other
 *   processes from calling the EEPROM interface functions from outside of the EEPROM File System.
 *
 * Mutual Exclusion:
 *   Mutual exclusion is implemented by the functions EEFS_LibLock and EEFS_LibUnlock.  Since the EEPROM File System is not
 *   intended to be used very often and to keep things simple it was decided to implement a single locking mechanism that is
 *   shared by all EEPROM File System volumes.  This locking mechanism simply locks the shared resource at the start of each
 *   function and unlocks the shared resource at the end of each function.  It is recommended that semaphores be used as the
 *   locking mechanism vs disabling interrupts.  Note that since the shared resource is locked for all lower level functions,
 *   lower level functions should not be called recursively.  The implementation of the EEFS_LibLock and EEFS_LibUnlock
 *   functions are defined as macros in the file eefs_macros.h.
 *
 *   The EEFS_Lock and EEFS_Unlock functions are intended to protect the following resources from shared access:
 *   1. File Descriptor Table - File Descriptors are maintained in a single table that is shared by all EEFS file systems.
 *   2. Inode Table - Some functions require that the state of the file system be preserved during critical sections of code.
 *   3. File Directory Descriptor Table - The File Directory Table is shared by all EEFS file systems.
 *   4. EEPROM interface routines - The implementation of these functions is unknown since they may be implementation specific.
 *
 * Time Stamps:
 *   Time Stamps are implemented by the function EEFS_LibTime.  Time stamps are based on the standard library time_t.  The
 *   implementation of the EEFS_LibTime function is defined as a macro in the file eefs_macros.h.  By default this macro is
 *   defined to use the standard library time function.
 *
 * Directories:
 *   The EEPROM File System only supports a single top level directory and does not support sub directories.  If you want to
 *   group files separately then they should be placed in different volumes.  For example /EEFS0_Apps for apps, /EEFS0_Tables
 *   for tables etc...
 *
 * CRC's:
 *   The EEPROM File System includes a crc in the File Allocation Table and a crc in the File Header for each file.  Currently
 *   the crc included in the File Allocation Table is calculated across the entire file system, including unused space
 *   (i.e. MaxEepromSize).  The crc included in each File Header is calculated only across the File Header and the File Data
 *   and does not include unused space at the end of the file.  Note that the crc's are currently NOT used by the file system
 *   and are NOT automatically updated by the file system when files are modified, this must be done manually.  The crc
 *   included in the File Allocation Table is only used by the bootstrap code to verify the integrity of the file system at
 *   boot time.
 *
 *   The original design was that the crc included in the File Allocation Table would cover only the File Allocation Table and
 *   to validate the entire file system you would also need to verify the crc included in each File Header.  The advantage
 *   to maintaining separate crc's is that if a file changes, only the file crc must be updated, where in the current
 *   implementation the same EEPROM address must be repeatedly rewritten to update the crc for every change made to the
 *   file system.
 *
 * Micro EEPROM File System:
 *   The Micro version of the EEPROM file system allows bootstrap code access to files in an EEPROM File System.  The full
 *   implementation of the EEPROM File System is too large to be used in bootstrap code so a simple single function version
 *   was developed that returns the starting address of a file given its filename.  The bootstrap code can then boot the
 *   system from a kernel image that is contained in an EEPROM File System.  This software is designed to use very little
 *   memory, and is independent of the file system size (i.e. maximum number of files).  This means that the bootstrap image
 *   will NOT have to be updated whenever the size of the EEPROM File System changes.
 *
 * Building a File System Image:
 *   EEPROM File System images are created using the geneepromfs tool.  This command line tool reads an input file that
 *   describes the files that will be included in the file system and outputs an EEPROM File System image ready to be
 *   burned into EEPROM.
