/*
** Filename: eefs_filesys.h
**
** Purpose: This file contains the higher level api interface function to the eefs_fileapi.c code.  This layer of the file
**   system supports multiple devices and volumes where the eefs_fileapi.c layer only focuses on a single file system.
**   Most of the functions in this file are essentually wrappers for the lower level function contained in eefs_fileapi.c.
**   All api functions are designed to be as similar to a standard unix filesystem api as possible.
**
** Design Notes:
**
** The Device Table:
**   The device table defines multiple devices or instances of the eeprom file system.  The device table is initialized by
**   calling the function EEFS_InitFS and requires a unique device name and the base address if the file system in eeprom.
**
**   EEFS_InitFS("/EEDEV0", (uint32)FileSystemBaseAddress1);
**   EEFS_InitFS("/EEDEV1", (uint32)FileSystemBaseAddress2);
**
** The Volume Table:
**   In order to access a device it must be mounted by calling the function EEFS_Mount.  Mounting the device maps a volume name
**   or mount point to the device.
**
**   EEFS_Mount("/EEDEV0", "/EEFS0");
**   EEFS_Mount("/EEDEV1", "/EEFS1");
**
**   Once the file system is mounted then it can be accessed by providing the path of the file as follows:
**   "/MountPoint/Filename"
**
** References:
**
**   See eefs_fileapi.h for additional information.
