/*
** Filename: eefs_vxworks.h
**
** Purpose: This file contains vxWorks Device Driver functions for the EEPROM File System.
**
** Design Notes:
**
** 1. Call EEFS_DrvInstall() to add the device driver to the vxWorks driver table.  This function should only be called
**    once during initialization.
** 2. Call EEFS_DevCreate() for each file system to add it to the vxWorks device list.  Separate device descriptos must
**    be declared for each file system.
**
** For Example:
**
** EEFS_DeviceDescriptor_t EEFS_Bank1;
** EEFS_DeviceDescriptor_t EEFS_Bank2;
**
** Startup()
** {
**     int DriverNumber;
**
**     DriverNumber = EEFS_DrvInstall();
**     EEFS_DevCreate(DriverNumber, "/EEFS1", EEFS_Bank1StartAddress, &EEFS_Bank1);
**     EEFS_DevCreate(DriverNumber, "/EEFS2", EEFS_Bank2StartAddress, &EEFS_Bank2);
** }
